Dependencies
============

- Pre-version-7 GHC (NC thinks ...).
- Default `cabal install` directory on $PATH (~/.cabal/bin
  for default "per-user" Cabal setup).

Install
=======

Do `make` to install trellys locally.  A trellys binary is linked to
./test/trellys, the only place you're expected to run it.  NB: this
does *not* put a trellys binary on your $PATH, so if you have one,
then it's probably out of date.

Dir Summary
===========

lib: libraries maintained by others
src: trellys language source
test: example .trellys files
