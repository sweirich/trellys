-- Nat elimination with examples.

-- Goal was to write an Ackermann's function using higher-order
-- primitive recursion.  This is easy, but NC was surprised when he
-- heard this could be done, because Ackermann is not (first-order)
-- primitive recursive.
--
-- Includes an example (add') where the lack of extensionality for
-- Pi-types had to be worked around.

-- --------------------------------

-- Higher-order primitive recursion / nat
-- elimination. Cf. Vecters.recvec.
primrec : [p: (n:Nat) -> Type 0]
       -> (base:p 0)
       -> (step: (n:Nat) -> (pn:p n) -> p (Succ n))
       -> (n:Nat) -> p n
primrec = \[p]. \base. \step. recnat pr n =
  case n [neq] of
    -- sym is evidence of backwards equality.
    Zero    -> conv base                  by (sym Nat Nat n Zero      neq) at x.p x
    Succ n' -> conv step n' (pr n' [neq]) by (sym Nat Nat n (Succ n') neq) at x.p x

-- Higher order primitive recursion with a constant predicate / nat
-- elimination: easier to compute terms with, when it works, but not
-- much use for proofs.
foldNat : [p: Type 0] -> (base:p) -> (step: (pn:p) -> p) -> (n:Nat) -> p
foldNat = \[p]. \base. \step. recnat pr n =

-- Addition
-- --------

-- First with primrec

-- Need a predicate with constant value Nat.
--
-- Can build one from const, but it's too much trouble to use ...
const : [aT:Type 1] -> [bT:Type 0] -> (a:aT) -> (b:bT) -> aT
const = \[aT] [bT] a b.a

-- ... it's better to specialize const
constNat : (w:Nat) -> Type 0
constNat = \w.Nat

-- Now get addition, a heavily conv'd version of
--
--   add' = \m. primrec [constNat] m (\n.\add_m_n.Succ add_m_n)
add' : (m:Nat) -> (n:Nat) -> Nat
add' =
  \m. \n.
  -- I don't know how (or if it's even possible, since we don't have
  -- extensionality?) to prove equality of arrow types for the
  -- n-eta-reduced version, but it's easy to conv the body of the
  -- n-eta-expanded version:
    conv
      (primrec
        [constNat]
        (conv m by (join: Nat = (constNat 0)) at x.x)
        (\n.\mn.conv (Succ (conv mn by (join: (constNat n) = Nat) at x.x))
                  by (join: Nat = (constNat (Succ n))) at x.x)
        n)
      by (join: (constNat n) = Nat) at x.x
-- trellys can't infer type for [\w.Nat] and annotation causes parse
-- error in my first attempt:
--
--   add' = \m. primrec [\w.Nat : ((w:Nat) -> Type 0)] m (\n.\mn.Succ mn)
--
-- Is this a bug? I'll create a separate, simpler, example ...
-- ... UPDATE: I can't find a simple version, maybe I imagined the problem :P


-- Then with foldNat, which is much easier.
add'' : (m:Nat) -> (n:Nat) -> Nat
add'' = \m. foldNat [Nat] m (\mn.Succ mn)
