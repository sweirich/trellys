module Existentials where

-- There are infinitely many sigma types in Trellys, since we don't
-- have logicality, erasure, or universe polymorphism.  The schema is
--
--   Exists (T: Type n1) (P : (_:^t1_e1 T) -> Type n2) -> Type n3 where
--     Ex : (w:^t1_e1 T) -> (_:^t2_e2 P w) -> Exists T P
--
-- where n1, n2, and n3 are type levels, e1 and e2 are erasures
-- (epsilons), and t1 and t2 are logicalities (thetas).

-- Here's our third n1 = n2 = n3 = 0 and e3 = + existential:
