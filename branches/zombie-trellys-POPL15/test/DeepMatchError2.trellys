--It is an error to match against an abstract datatype.

-- It's not obvious that you could actually do so in a well-typed program anyway.
-- The following example would fail to typecheck for a different reason, but
-- the "abstract datatype" error message gets triggered first.

data C : Type 0 where
  MkC of (x : C) (y : (case x [_] of mkFoo -> Nat  : Type 0))
