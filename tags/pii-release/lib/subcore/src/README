To compile, you need OCaml.  I used OCaml 3.11.2, and I do not believe
I am using any advanced features.

Then just run "make".

Tests are in tests/, particularly tests/encode.sub.

The grammar for the language is in subcore.gra.  I have a tool called gt 
(https://github.com/jjmeyer0/gt) which generates most of the other OCaml
source files from that .gra file.

The source code that was not auto-generated is all in main.ml.
