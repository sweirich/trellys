Dependencies
============

- Pre-version-7 GHC (NC thinks ...).
- Default `cabal install` directory on $PATH (~/.cabal/bin
  for default "per-user" Cabal setup).

Install
=======

Do `make` to install trellys locally.  A trellys binary is linked to
./test/trellys, the only place you're expected to run it.  NB: this
does *not* put a trellys binary on your $PATH, so if you have one,
then it's probably out of date.

Do `make install` to install trellys globally.  Plain `make` is 
preferred, but `make install` should work on broken Cygwin setups where
plain `make` fails.

Install Trouble?
================

After major changes, e.g. a GHC version upgrade, you may have to delete 
the ./.capri directory from your working copy before doing a fresh 
`make install`.

Dir Summary
===========
