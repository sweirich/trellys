-- E.g., n should be free in the erasure of all of these lambdas:
t1 : [Nat] -> Nat
t1 = \[n] . n

t2 : [Nat] -> Nat
t2 = \[n] . case n [_] of
              Zero    -> Zero
              Succ n' -> Zero

t3 : [Nat] -> Nat
t3 = \[n] . let n' [_] = n in n'

-- and here the error message shows that n is indeed free in the
-- erasure:
j1 : t1 [Zero] = Zero
j1 = join
