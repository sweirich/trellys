* bug
- (NC) correctly parenthesize nested applications in error messages
  (see ErrorFormatBug.trellys)

* feature
- (NC) allow comments anywhere (currently comments on first line are
  not allowed)
- (NC) add support for C preprocessor (simple version is 
  `cpp <file> | grep -v '^#'`)
- (AS,NC) remove trailing number from variable names in error messages (at
  least when not ambiguous, maybe that's the tricky part ...)
- (NC) hierarchical module system
- (NC) make "implicit var appears free in body" error show *where* the
  variable appears free
