# Main Rules
# ==========
#
# make [all]: does a sandboxed install of zombie trellys.
#             Assumes you have Cabal installed, and that the default
#             Cabal install dir is on your path (~/.cabal/bin for
#             default "per-user" setup).  A trellys binary will be
#             installed in ./cabal-dev/bin/trellys, and symlinked
#             to test/trellys (the only place you're expected to run
#             `trellys`).
#
# make test:  runs all tests in ./test.
#
# make sandbox-trellys:
#             does a sandboxed install or trellys-core.  Quicker than
#             `make all`. Assumes you ran `make all` previously.
#
# make install: does a `cabal install` of trellys-core.
#
# make ghci, make cabal-dev-ghci: start ghci with appropriate includes.
