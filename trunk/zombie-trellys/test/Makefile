# Main Rules
# ==========
#
# make [all]: does a regression test, by checking that everything that
#             was correctly passing (failing) type checking is still
#             passing (failing) type checking.
#
# make todo: tests if known-broken things are still broken.  If you
#            fix something in TODO_PASS (TODO_FAIL) then you should
#            move it to PASS (FAIL).

# Use bash to run targets.
SHELL=/bin/bash

# PASS are tests that *should* always pass.
